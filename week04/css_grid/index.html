            <p>The Fox Venice Theatre, the quintessential Venice institution, was operated by Cumberland Mountain Theaters, Inc. from 1973 to early 1979. Previously it had faltered under National General Corporation operation as a large, single screen neighborhood theatre in the new era of multiplexes. (An econo-historical-nostalgic note: During the Cumberland reign, admission eventually stabilized at $2 for adults, $1 for children and senior citizens.)</p>
            <p>Cumberland Mountain Theaters was a spin-off of the Cumberland Mountain Film Company, which was housed in a loft space above the theatre from 1969 through 1988. The Single Wing Turquoise Bird Light Show also operated in that studio space. Rol Murrow has described that group's final performance, Freak Night. He says, "There were lots of folks who deserve credit for the Fox, Cumberland, The Single Wing Turquoise Bird, etc."</p>
            <p>I would guess that the number of folks whose combined creativity and imagination made the Fox what it was, extends into the high hundreds at least. The Fox reached out for and embraced the most original people in a megalopolis jam-packed with original people, and drew them to the shabby environs of 620 Lincoln Boulevard, to do their thing or to be magnificently, intelligently entertained, or both.</p>
            <p>During the boom years of its existence a Fox Venice schedule was the hip accessory for every self-respecting refrigerator door in Los Angeles. The theatre's mailing list read like a who's-who of the entertainment industry. The schedules (printed by Peace Press during the Cumberland tenure) featured, on the front, pictorial representations of the films, usually double features, and on the back, capsule descriptions telling why each and every one was a must-see. For some people that was true, and they came almost every night!</p>   
            <p>The schedule included a notice to filmmakers: "We want to see your movies! We are screening and cataloging many films, many rarely seen, for possible exhibition," and alerted them that the theatre was available during the day for special screenings in 35mm or 16mm formats. On another occasion, the back of the schedule said, "Our audiences want to see your short films!...Our audiences are distinctly expressive in their appreciation! The Fabulous Fox may even be able to qualify your film for Academy Award consideration."</p>
